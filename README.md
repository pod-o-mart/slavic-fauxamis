# slavic-fauxamis / False Friends in Slavic Languages

## About
This database system is a collection of 'false friends' (shared words having different meanings) between Slavic languages, e.g. Russian–Polish, Macedonian–Upper Sorbian, Belarusian–Serbian, etc.

[Read more about the database here](https://pod-o-mart.github.io/slavic-fauxamis/about.html).

The database system was initially published in 2020 on the [Danish Portal for Slavonic, Balkan and East European Studies](https://oesteuropastudier.dk/en/dictionaries/fauxamis). As I do not have the ressources to maintain the code anymore, I have decided to publish the code on Github to anyone.
